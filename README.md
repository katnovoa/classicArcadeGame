## What is the Classic Arcade Game
A little recreation of the classic arcade game Frogger. The goal is to get your character from the grass over the road and into the water, all while avoiding collision with the ugly bugs

## Challange
Avoid the bugs that travel on the road. If the player collides with the bugs, the player is reset back at the beginning. Upon reaching the water, User wins and gets the opportunity to start again.

## Game Instructions
Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, move upwards. Avoid the bugs at all cost and try and get to the water. If you made it in the water, you can play again. If you collided with a bug, start again!
